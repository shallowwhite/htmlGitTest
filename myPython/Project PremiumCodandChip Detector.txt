Defined by google maps from following in order of importance
    Number of Comments (Above 500) if not reached dont display
    Rating (4 stars or above) if not reached dont display
    Whether has restaurant in text - nice to have

Displays other info when clicked on map including opening times

If this can then display drive times etc all the better

Must include some loveable chip type cheeky character/mascot

Favorite and always display stroed locations, once the target has been entered and tested i.e. Chesters, Trenchers

Future functionally ideas - add all wimpy locations by default with beefeater guy graphic
